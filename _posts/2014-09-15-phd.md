After 4.5 long years, I'm finally done with my Ph.D. studies! It has been a long journey but well worth it. I couldn't have 
made it that far without the continuous support of my amazing supervisor Ondřej Lhoták and the support of 
my family, especially my wife, Sarah Nadi. If you're interested, you can find my dissertation published [here][phd].
