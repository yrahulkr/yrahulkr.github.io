I am currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computing Science at the University of Alberta. Priori to that, I spent 1.5 years as a postdoctoral researcher at Technische Universität Darmstadt, Germany within the [Secure Software Engineering (SSE) Group](https://blogs.uni-paderborn.de/sse/){:target="_blank"} led by [Eric Bodden](http://bodden.de/){:target="_blank"}.

Just before moving to Germany, I finished my Ph.D. studies under the supervision of [Ondřej Lhoták](https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~olhotak/){:target="_blank"} in the [Programming Languages Group](https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/){:target="_blank"} at the University of Waterloo. You can find my thesis: **The Separate Compilation Assumption** [here](http://hdl.handle.net/10012/8835){:target="_blank"}.

Prior to that, I received my MMath degree at the University of Waterloo in 2010 when I was part of the Security Research Group led by [Raouf Boutaba](http://rboutaba.cs.uwaterloo.ca/index.html){:target="_blank"}.

You can find my more detailed CV [here][cvpdf]{:target="_blank"}.
