I recently obtained my doctoral degree from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of British Columbia. During my PhD, I worked under the supervision of Dr. Ali Mesbah and developed tools and techniques to automatically test web applications.

 Prior to that, I worked as Blue Scholar, and Software Engineer at [IBM Research, India](https://www.research.ibm.com/labs/india/) for five years between 2012 and 2017. During my time at IBM, I worked on building tools for automated web and mobile testing. 

I obtained my bachelors and masters in the department of Computer Science and Engineering at [IIT Kanpur](www.iitk.ac.in). As part of my masters' thesis, I designed and implemented a Public Key Cryptography based authentication protocol using smart cards to develop a cost-effective Secure Money Dispenser that can work with intermittent network connectivity.
