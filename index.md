Automated Web Testing is an area limited by the ability of current exploration techniques in generating accurate web app models.  My interests span programming languages, software systems, and software engineering.

Below is a list of my current and inactive projects.
<!--
### Current Projects
{% assign current = site.data.projects | where_exp: "project", "project.end == nil" %}
{% include projects.html data=current %}-->
<!--
### Inactive Projects
{% assign inactive = site.data.projects | where_exp: "project", "project.end != nil" %}
{% include projects.html data=inactive %}-->
